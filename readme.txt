list. You can set shortcode attribues and see a preview of the result before

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What version of WooThemes do I need? =

Themes from WooThemes.com come in two parts: the theme files and the
WooFramework. The important part is the WooFramework version. You will need
at least version **2.9** (released in August 2010) of the framework, because
that's when the shortcodes were introduced.

= How do I know which WooFramework version I have? =

In the WooThemes admin panel, look at the top right corner. Note that there will
be two version numbers: one for the actual theme and one for the framework. 

The Shortcode Ninja plugin will tell you if the version is not recent
enough and what to do about it.

= How do I update the WooFramework? =

You can find instructions how to update the WooFramework here: 
http://www.woothemes.com/2009/08/how-to-upgrade-your-theme/#update-4

Always remember to backup your current theme before making changes.
